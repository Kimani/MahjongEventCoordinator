- Base implementation:
*Player Inputs (ID, Name, Sub=false, score=0.0)

*3 Rounds, 1 Final

*Final Round (Top 4 divide by 4 for score, everyone else divide by 2)
**Top 4 (minus subs) face each other, everyone else is sorted to the tables (5 at T1, 6 at T2, etc)

*sort()
*finalsort()

*UpdatePlayer Method: Takes playerdata between rounds and puts it back into EventData.Players.
